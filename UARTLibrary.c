 * This is intended to be compiled as an AVR Library Project and
 * used by other programs. After compiling this code, copy the
 * libUSART1Library.a and USART1Library.h files to the project directory,
 * then add the library to the target project by R-clicking on the
 * project's Libraries directory and clicking Add Library. Also,
 * the USART1Library.h file must be #included in the project's .c file.
 *
 * NOTE: This library only works with the default USART1 port
 * on the ReadyAVR (so JP2 must have jumpers on PD3 and PD2).

// Use USART1_init to initialize the USART hardware in the AVR processor.
// The function takes the following arguments:
//    - desired baud rate (standard values from 2400 to 115200),
//    - number of databits (5-8),
//    - number of stop bits (1,2),
//    - parity (0=no parity, 1=odd parity, 2=even parity).
// No error checking is performed and the function does not return a value.
//
// For example,
//     usart1_init(9600,8,1,0);
// sets the baudrate to 9600, with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity
void uart_init(long unsigned int baudrate, unsigned char databits, unsigned char stopbits, unsigned char parity) {
    /* your code here */
	// set baud rate (via UBRR0 high and low registers)
    
	// set databits
    
	// set parity
    
    // set stopbits
    
	// finally, enable receiver and transmitter
    
}

// This function waits for space in the USART transmit buffer. When space
// is available, the function places an unsigned character value (passed in
// as the function's only argument) in the buffer and returns. No error
// checking is performed and the function does not return a value.
void uart_tx(unsigned char data) {
    /* your code here */

}

// This function blocks until a character is received in the USART input
// buffer. Once a character arrives, it is passed back to the caller as
// an unsigned character. No error checking is performed.
