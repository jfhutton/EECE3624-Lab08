# Lab08
In this lab you will use the ReadyAVR to create a simple RS232 communications server, and youâ€™ll communicate with it using the PuTTY terminal program. You will also create a library of RS232 functions to configure the ATmega128a for serial communication as well as to send and receive characters. 

Have fun!
